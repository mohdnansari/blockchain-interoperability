1) when you bring up the node server, html/index.html is served. hence the token needs to be updated there for the query to run
2) CORS will make only IE run these requests. Firefox and chrome are blocking the requests.
3) for the bluemix side api calls to run, a separate server (fabcar browser version) needs to be run (port=3000). the requests will be routed through this. 



*************** working services

** server fetching data from bluemix blockchain service
C:\Users\IBM_ADMIN\fabric-samples\fabcar-bmx-browser

** interoperability page front end 
C:\Users\IBM_ADMIN\express-html-interop

** 
Blockchain-hello2 is the bluemix service where coldchain has been deployed

one example asset on this baas instance is: CPKG20180918U01

{"asset":{"assetID":"CPKG20181028U01"}}


CPKG20181028U01



## troubleshooting:

1) if sap baas doesnt create/read asset - we may have to update oauth token in index.html
2) if ibm baas doesnt react, see the server console window for any errors
